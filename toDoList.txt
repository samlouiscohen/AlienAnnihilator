TO DO:


-Refactor Code: Design generic ship & Alien classes (Will be useful for later inheritance of alien species)

-Work on collisions: alien & ship/ alien & laser and also the outcomes of each

-Improve ship motion

-**Allow for multiple finger input: So ship doesnâ€™t freeze when shooting

-Design gun classes: Some sort of reload mechanism to provide a reasonable delay between allowed shots. Also necessary for future laser upgrades or powers (inheritance of some generic laser)

-Implement sound effects and look for a background track to play

-Consider shooting from all angles (or just right to left?) - could be better game play

-Look into multiplayer: Maybe two ships fighting across from one another with aliens attacking simultaneously 

-Look into process of submitting to apple
